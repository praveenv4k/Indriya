\lhead{Chapter 4. \emph{Software Framework}} 
		The ROS\cite{quigley2009ros} is the de facto standard used for any robotics related research in the recent times. However it is officially supported only for the Ubuntu distribution which makes it unavailable to the people who work with sensors that are being support only for Windows system (i.e Kinect for windows v2). Hence a distributed architecture which is not specific to any operating system or programming language is proposed which uses open network communication standards and transparent message passing using structured data. In this chapter the design philosophy of the software framework and core components of the system are explained.
