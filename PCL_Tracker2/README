Twiddling around with the PCL tracking lib.

Combines the tracking example:
http://www.willowgarage.com/blog/2012/01/17/tracking-3d-objects-point-cloud-library
with the template alignment example:
http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/template_alignment.php

Allows you to run the tracker to capture a reference cloud into a file by
segmenting the scene. Can then start the tracker from the saved reference,
which segments the scene,  searches for the reference and starts the
tracker.

== Build ==

To build you will need PCL installed. See: http://pointclouds.org/downloads/
Code developed against version 1.5 installed on Ubuntu Precise from the
pointclouds.org packages.

Like the PCL examples we use cmake. For a simple command line compile:

 git clone git://github.com/markpitchless/openni_tracking_mda.git
 cd openni_tracking_mda/
 mkdir build
 cd build/
 cmake ..
 make

For other setups like eclipse see: http://www.cmake.org

== Run ==

You will need to find the right serial for your openni camera, e.g.
B00365724334051B. Then:

 ./openni_tracking B00365724334051B

Run the original tracker setup, starts up, segments the scene, picks the
nearest cluster and starts tracking. Placing the object on flat horizontal
service like a table or the floor works well.

 ./openni_tracking B00365724334051B --save

Same as first command except the referance cloud (ie the object to track) is
saved to reference.pcd.

 ./openni_tracking B00365724334051B --load

Load reference.pcd, find it in the scene and start tracking.

Note that being experimental code it will also save out all sorts of debug pcd
files while processing!
